# SelectiveShortener
Removes all instances of the letters A, E, I, and O from .docx files in order to shorten them

This is a simple program I wrote that removes the 4 of of the 5 vowels from a .docx file in order to make it shorter. I created this simple program because I was in need of a way to quickly shorten a cheat sheet that I was going to use for a final exam. We were allowed to have 1 page (8.5" x 11") but just the front side for this exam. The issue is that I had used the full sheet for all my past exams in this class, and need a way to quickly cut some bloat but have the information still be readable!
